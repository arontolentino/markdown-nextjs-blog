# Aron Tolentino

Hey, I'm a Software Development Manager at [Outgive](https://outgive.ca/).

By day, I lead a team of 5 developers that build analytics and accounting tools for Amazon sellers.

By night, I build profitable internet businesses and share my love for software development to anyone who will listen.

I write blog <Link href="/posts">posts</Link> about my learnings here.
